	We start with an introduction to Game Theory.
	I have tried to make this report interesting and also covered fundamentals.
	Still, this is just a \emph{glimpse} of an extensive topic like Game Theory.
	This report is divided into parts: Theoretical foundations of Non-Cooperative Game Theory followed by Cooperative Game Theory then Mechanism Design\footnote{only Non-Cooperative Game Theory is covered in Midterm Report}.
	% Next, we examine Stochastic Systems.
	% On our way, we will look at corresponding Linear Systems to gain insight onto Nonlinear ones.
	% Then, we explore Chaos and Fractals.
	Finally, I encourage you to look at different Games and their exciting results.
