\section{Dominant Strategy Equilibria}
We start the section with the notion of strong dominance.
Subsequently, we introduce the notions of weak dominance and very weak dominance.
\subsection{Strong Dominance}
\begin{defn}[Strongly Dominated Strategy]
    Given a strategic form game $\Gamma = \langle N,(S_i),(u_i)\rangle$, a strategy $s_i \in S_i$ of player $i$ is said to be strongly dominated by another strategy $s^\prime_i \in S_i$
    \[u_i(s^\prime_i,s_{-i})> u_i(s_i,s_{-i})\ \forall s_{-i} \in S_{-i}\]
\end{defn}
We also say strategy $s^\prime_i$ strongly dominates strategy $s_i$.
\begin{defn}[Strongly Dominant Strategy]
    A strategy $s^*_i \in S_i$ is said to be strongly dominant for player $i$ if it strongly dominates every other strategy $s_i \in S_i$.
    That is $\forall s_i\neq s_i^*,$
    \[u_i(s^*_i,s_{-i})> u_i(s_i,s_{-i})\ \forall s_{-i} \in S_{-i}\]
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Strongly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium]
    A strategy profile $(s_1^*,s_2^*,\ldots,s_n^*)$ is called a strongly dominated strategy equilibrium of the game $\Gamma = \langle N,(S_i),(u_i)\rangle$ if, $\forall i=1,2,\ldots,n$, the strategy $s_i^*$ is a strongly dominated strategy for player $i$.
\end{defn}
Clearly, if a (rational) player has a strongly dominant strategy, then we should expect the player to choose that strategy.
On the other hand, if a player has a strongly dominated strategy, then we should expect the player not to play it.

Recall, Prisoner's Dilemma, $C$ is a strongly dominant strategy for Bill and also for Bob. Therefore $(C, C)$ is a \textbf{strongly dominant strategy equilibrium} for this game.
\subsection{Weak Dominance}
\begin{defn}[Weakly Dominated Strategy]
    A strategy $s_i \in S_i$ of player $i$ is said to be weakly dominated by another strategy $s^\prime_i \in S_i$
    \[u_i(s^\prime_i,s_{-i})\geq u_i(s_i,s_{-i})\ \forall s_{-i} \in S_{-i}\quad \text{and}\quad u_i(s^\prime_i,s_{-i})> u_i(s_i,s_{-i})\ \text{for some} s_{-i} \in S_{-i}\]
\end{defn}
The strategy $s^\prime_i$ weakly dominates strategy $s_i$.

The strict inequality is to be satisfied for at least one $s_{-i}$.
\begin{defn}[Weakly Dominant Strategy]
    A strategy $s^*_i \in S_i$ is said to be weakly dominant for player $i$ if it weakly dominates every other strategy $s_i \in S_i$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium]
    A strategy profile $(s_1^*,s_2^*,\ldots,s_n^*)$ is called a weakly dominated strategy equilibrium of the game $\Gamma = \langle N,(S_i),(u_i)\rangle$ if, $\forall i=1,2,\ldots,n$, the strategy $s_i^*$ is a weakly dominated strategy for player $i$.
\end{defn}
\subsection{Very Weak Dominance}
\begin{defn}[Very Weakly Dominated Strategy]
    A strategy $s_i \in S_i$ of player $i$ is said to be very weakly dominated by another strategy $s^\prime_i \in S_i$
    \[u_i(s^\prime_i,s_{-i})\geq u_i(s_i,s_{-i})\ \forall s_{-i} \in S_{-i}\]
\end{defn}
The strategy $s^\prime_i$ very weakly dominates strategy $s_i$.

Here, the strict inequality need not be satisfied for any $s_{-i}$ unlike in the case of weak dominance where strict inequality must be satisfied for at least one $s_{-i}$.
\begin{defn}[Very Weakly Dominant Strategy]
    A strategy $s^*_i \in S_i$ is said to be very weakly dominant for player $i$ if it very weakly dominates every other strategy $s_i \in S_i$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Very Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium]
    A strategy profile $(s_1^*,s_2^*,\ldots,s_n^*)$ is called a very weakly dominated strategy equilibrium of the game $\Gamma = \langle N,(S_i),(u_i)\rangle$ if, $\forall i=1,2,\ldots,n$, the strategy $s_i^*$ is a very weakly dominated strategy for player $i$.
\end{defn}

Dominant strategy equilibria (strongly dominant, weakly dominant, very weakly dominant), if they exist, are very desirable, however, rarely do they exist because the conditions to be satisfied are quite demanding.
A dominant strategy equilibrium requires that each playerâ€™s strategy be a best response strategy against all possible strategy choices of the other players.
